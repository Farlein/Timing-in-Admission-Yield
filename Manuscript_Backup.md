## Introduction
Motivation
Estimating the tuition revenue of undergraduate students is a critical part of the budgetary planning [@trusheim2011predictive], as higher education institutions become more reliant on tuition to support operation [@barringer2016changing; @mitchell2016funding]. With tuition rates usualy being stable or stably increasing, predicting undergraduate student tuition revenue relies on acurate enrollment projection. Enrollment projection can be divided into two parts, admission of new students and retention of continuing students. In this project, we build a tool to predict weekly yield in the admission season, between end of Feburary and beginning of May. Institutional administrative units such as the Budget Office and the Admission Office can use this tool to monitor the gap between admission targets and potential outcomes and adjust the expected tuition revenue from incoming students accordingly.

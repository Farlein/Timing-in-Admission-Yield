<h1 class="title">When They Will Pay: Understand Deposit Decisions in
College Admission</h1>
</header>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Motivation Recruitment of new students is a challenging task of
enrollment management for many institutions of higher education, since
they need to meet revenue goals, ensure academic ability and promote
diversity of the student body <span class="citation"
data-cites="adams2019higher maldonado2017assessing">(Adams-Johnson et
al. 2019; Maldonado, Armelini, and Guevara 2017)</span>. The recruitment
process includes several general stages, searching and answering
inquries of propsective applicants, reviewing application materials and
making admission decisions, encouraging admitted students to pay
deposits, and assisting with students’ matriculation. This project
focuses on the deposit stage where students’ choices play an important
role. Understanding students’ decision to pay deposits can help
institutions to design marketing and recruitment strategies <span
class="citation"
data-cites="desjardins2002analytic johnson2019destinations">(DesJardins
2002; Johnson 2019)</span>.</p>
<p>Summary of previous studies Previous studies have provided valuable
insights on improving recruitment efforts by investigating various
factors which could affect admission outcome. DesJardins <span
class="citation" data-cites="desjardins2002analytic">(DesJardins
2002)</span> used predictive models to segment students, so enrollment
managers could focused on student groups of interest who have similar
probabilities to enroll or not. Maldonado et al. <span class="citation"
data-cites="maldonado2017assessing">(Maldonado, Armelini, and Guevara
2017)</span> developed nested logit models to predict students’
enrollment probabilities, and the decision makers utilized the models to
allocate resources for admission activities. Goenner and Pauls <span
class="citation" data-cites="goenner2006predictive">(Goenner and Pauls
2006)</span> predicted the enrollment probabilities of inquirers to help
University of North Dakota allocate recruitment efforts by geographic
areas. Braunstein et al. <span class="citation"
data-cites="braunstein1999measuring">(Braunstein, McGrath, and
Pescatrice 1999)</span> focused on the factors related to student
financials on enrollment decisions of admitted students, so the
particular institution can understand the effects of various financial
aids and how they affect students differently from various
socio-economic backgrounds. Johnson <span class="citation"
data-cites="johnson2019destinations">(Johnson 2019)</span> studied
various factors associated with enrollment decisions of out-of-state
students with multiple potential destinations and provided insights on
why the students accepted their offer of admission or chose another
instittion.</p>
<p>Difference from previous studies The previous studies however made
two implicit assumptions. One was all factors had time independent
values, and the other was all factors had time independent effects.
Indeed, many factors related to admission process are time independent,
e.g., racial ethnicity and HS GPA, but others may easily violate the
assumption, e.g., institutional financial aid offered and student loan
borrowed. On the other hand, even time independent factors could have
time varying effects. For example, Pell eligible students are more
likely to pay deposit when they had to, i.e., when deposit deadline
approaches, so Pell eligibility does not matter in the early admission
season but is important later. As a result, the colleagues of the
Admission Office want to understand not only whether a factor could
affect students’ decisions, but also how the factor affect decisions in
different time periods. Moreover, the Admission Office pay a lot of
attention to deposit paid before considering about matriculating
students, so it is useful to model students’ decision to pay deposit,
rather than modeling enrollment decisions directly.</p>
<p>Contribution of this study This study provides new insights in
factors affecting admission outcome to help with recruitment efforts.
First, we model students’ journey from being admitted to deciding to pay
deposit. Event history analysis is used to model the admission journey,
similar to those modeling students’ journey from matriculation to
graduation <span class="citation"
data-cites="gross2013financial zhan2018much chen2017effects">(Gross,
Torres, and Zerquera 2013; Zhan, Xiang, and Elliott III 2018; Chen and
Hossler 2017)</span>. However, instead of using the popular proportional
hazard models, we developed stepwise exponential models to accommodate
time varying factors and time varying effects. We further introduce
Bayesian Hierarchical framework to event history analysis. The framework
provides balance between overfitting and underfitting, so true
time-varing effects are not exaggerated by noise in observed data or
ignored by model assumptions. Second, we model deposit decisions instead
of enrollment decisions. Although enrollment decision is the final
outcome of interest, in practice the Admission Office need to work
sequentially to encourage paying deposits and then to prevent withdrawal
of deposits (which they call “summer melt”). They would like a tool to
understand whether/how factors affect deposit decisions. Third, we
include student activities as surrogates of students’ interests to the
admission offers, in addition to the factors usually included in
previous research such as demographic characteristics, socio-economic
background, high school academic performance and student financials.
More specifically, we investigate the effects of factors related to
students’ activities on the admission websites and campus visits.</p>
<p>Summary of results In this paper, we implement Bayesian hierarchical
event history analysis</p>
<h2 id="theoretical-backgound-and-pratical-application">Theoretical
Backgound and Pratical Application</h2>
<h3 id="admission-funnel">Admission Funnel</h3>
<p>An admission funnel invovles six processes, prospects, inquiries,
applicants, admits, deposits and enrolls <span class="citation"
data-cites="stonybrook">(<strong>stonybrook?</strong>)</span>. In the
prospect stage, the admission office search for high school students who
might be interested to the institution. In the inquiry stage, the
admission office communicate with students who expressed interest,
attempt to furhter enhance their interest, and encourage them to apply.
In the applicant stage, the admission office notify students with
incomplete application forms, process and review completed applications.
In the admit stage, the admission office make decisions to offer
admission, put students on a wait list, or reject applications. In the
deposit stage, the admission office prepare financial aid packages and
collaborate with other offices to interact with admitted students in
campus tours and other programs, in order to encourge the students to
accept the offers. In the enroll stage, the admission office continue to
engage with students and collaborate with other offices to help with new
student orientation, course registration and on-campus residency. There
are several important rates to monitor in the admission funnel,
conversion rate, selection rate, yield rate and melt rate <span
class="citation"
data-cites="ruffalonl">(<strong>ruffalonl?</strong>)</span>. Conversion
rate is The proportion of applicants from inquiries. Selection rate is
the proportion of admits from applicants. Yield rate is the proportion
of deposits from admits. Melt rate is the proportion of enrolls from
deposits. With melt rate typically closed to 1 or 100% at the University
of Delaware, the deposit stage or yield rate largely determines the
number of new students we will have.</p>
<h3 id="college-choice">College Choice</h3>
<h3 id="conceptual-framework">Conceptual Framework</h3>
<p>Our conceptual framework is developed from the theory of college
choice <span class="citation"
data-cites="chapman1979pricing hossler1989understanding">(Chapman 1979;
Hossler, Braxton, and Coopersmith 1989)</span>. The studies tried to
understand students’ enrollment decisions with their individual
characteristics and preferences. Students decide whether to pay deposit,
according to economic, sociological, and psychological factors <span
class="citation" data-cites="paulsen1990college">(Paulsen 1990)</span>.
Based on the theory of human capital <span class="citation"
data-cites="becker2009human">(Becker 2009)</span>, the economic factors
help students evaluate whether an institution provides the highest
potential benefit versus cost. From sociological perspective, students
choose the best institution for status attainment <span class="citation"
data-cites="hossler1999going">(Hossler, Schmit, and Vesper 1999)</span>,
and the choice is affect by their sociological background <span
class="citation" data-cites="johnson2019destinations">(Johnson
2019)</span>. The psychological factors impact students’ opinions on
institutional environment and climate, and students decide whether it is
a good fit to the institution <span class="citation"
data-cites="paulsen1990college">(Paulsen 1990)</span>. We hypothesis
that these factors not only affect students’ decision to pay deposit,
but also when they would like to pay deposit, i.e., these factors could
also affect students’ speed to make decisions. For admitted students,
they are willing to pay deposits sooner than later if they are admitted
to an institution with the best potential investment, status attainment,
and/or student-institution fit.</p>
<p>With the guidance of the college choice theory and previous studies,
we form the variable pool to reflect the three kinds of factors. The
economic factors include institutional financial aid offered, Pell
eligibility, expected family contribution (EFC), and time spent on
student finance service (SFS) websites. Financial aids affect students’
choice by reducing the cost of attendence. The grants and scholarships
can be from federal, state or institution. We do not include federal
grants, because few students obtained federal grants by the end of
deposit deadline. We do not include state scholarships, because they do
not apply to non-Delawarean students. Pell eligibility is a good
indicator for federal grants, because most Pell eligible students
eventually obtain the federal Pell grants. In addition, both Pell
eligibility and EFC indicate students’ sensitivity to cost and financial
aids. The time spent on SFS websites reflects students’ efforts to
evaludate the economic impact to attend the institution. The
sociological factors include gender and ethnicity. The psychological
factors include the period to receive admission offer, whether admitted
to the Honor College, whether applied major and admitted major are
different, loan borrowed, time spent on major finder websites, whether
attended recruitment events, and whether postpone to review admission
decision.</p>
<h2 id="data-and-variables">Data and Variables</h2>
<p>Admit, deposit and yield trend Data for this study were pulled from a
data reporting platform of the University of Delaware (UD), a public
research university (Carnegie classification: R1) with a population of
about 18,000 undergraduate students. We collected the weekly admission
data of out-of-state applicants between late February and early May from
Fall 2012 to Fall 2019. We chose late February as the starting point,
because most admission decisions were made by the Admission Office by
then and the Budget Office began to review the budget plan for the
coming fiscal year. Most students paid deposit in early May if they
accepted UD’s offer, so we used it as the end point. Table 1 shows the
number of admits and deposits by May 1 of each year. The number of
admitted out-of-state students gradually increased from about 12,500 to
about 15,000 from 2012 to 2019, and the number of deposited out-of-state
students fluctuated between 2200 and 2900. Figure 1 shows yield by week
for Fall 2017, Fall 2018 and Fall 2019. Week 11 always represents May 1,
and Week 1 represents 70 days before May 1, which is in late Feburary.
For all three falls, the yields increase slowly in early weeks in
February and March, increase faster in April, and jump in the last week
of April. The yield trends are more similar between Fall 2017 and Fall
2018, and the gap is larger between the trends of Fall 2018 and Fall
2019. Overall the sequence of week is a strong predictor for yield, and
thus is used as an independent variable in the models.</p>
<p>Student attributes In addition to the sequence of week, student
attributes are also included in the initial list of variables to predict
yields. Table 2 describes the dependent and indepent variables in the
models, and Table 3 shows the descriptive statistics of the variables.
The depedent variable is whether a student will pay deposit. The
independent variables include the student’s demographic information,
high school information, financial background, financial aid
information. We further include interaction between financial aid and
some other variables such as the interaction between institutional aid
rate and estimated family contrbution (EFC) rate, because we suspect the
effect of institutional aid rate can be affected by other variables.</p>
<h2 id="variable-selection">Variable Selection</h2>
<p>From the initial list of predictors, we select a subset with
consistently high predictive powers and use them as input of the
subsequent models. First, we randomly draw samples with replacement from
a fall’s data with date being May 1. Second, we fit LASSO regression to
predict yield and record which variables are selected and the
correpsonding coefficients. Third, we repeat the previous two steps 200
times, so we can calculate the probability of each variable being
selected for the fall. The higher the probability is, the higher
predictive power a variable has. Fourth, we repeat the previous three
steps for each fall, so we know which variables tend to have high
predictive powers over years. We select Yield from major, HS GPA, Feeder
HS, Institutional aid rate, EFC rate, African American, Asian, White,
and Inst*EFC. Fifth, we exclude variables with high variance of
coefficients. Even a variable is selected for each fall, the high
variance of coefficient indicates the predictive power is not
consistent, so it will hurt the predictive performance when a trained
model is applied to a test dataset. In this case, we calculate the
average coefficients for selected variables from last step for each
fall, and the calculate the standard deviation of the average
coefficients. All variables show relatively small standard deviation
except Yield from major which has standard deviation larger than 1, so
we exclude Yield from major. Therefore, the final list of predictors are
HS GPA, Feeder HS, Institutional aid rate, EFC rate, African American,
Asian, White, and Inst*EFC.</p>

## Introduction
Motivation
Recruitment of new students is a challenging task of enrollment management for many higher education institutions, since they need to meet revenue goals, ensure academic ability and promote diversity of the student body [@adams2019higher; @maldonado2017assessing]. The recruitment process includes several general stages, searching and answering inquries of propsective applicants, reviewing application materials and making admission decisions, encouraging admitted students to pay deposits, and assisting with students' matriculation [@litten1983applying]. Although matriculation is the final outcome, the deposit stage is really the last focus of the Admissions Office, because most students paying deposit will eventually matriculate. Other offices/departments in an institution pay attention to deposit situation too. The Budget Office would like to use deposits paid to estimate the tuition revenue from new students each fall. The Budget Office have to update budgetary planning in the spring, if the deposits paid are far away from the admission targets. Similarly, the Department of Housing needs to work on the potential shortage of dorm space in the spring, if too many deposits are paid. As a result, the Admissions Office track deposits usually by week in the spring and desire to understand admitted students' decision to pay deposits, not only whether they will pay, but also when they will pay, so they can adjust marketing and recruitment stratigies promptly [@desjardins2002analytic; @goenner2006predictive]. 

Summary of previous studies
Previous studies have provided valuable insights to understand students' enrollment decisions and assist with marketing and recruitment stratigies. DesJardins [@desjardins2002analytic] used predictive models to segment admitted students, and he suggested enrollment managers to focus on student groups who have enrollment probabilities close to 0.5. Maldonado et al. [@maldonado2017assessing] developed nested logit models to predict admitted students' enrollment probabilities, and the decision makers utilized the models to allocate resources for admission activities. Goenner and Pauls [@goenner2006predictive] predicted the enrollment probabilities of inquirers to help University of North Dakota allocate recruitment efforts by geographic area. Braunstein et al. [@braunstein1999measuring] focused on the effects of student financial factors on enrollment decisions of admitted students, so the particular institution could understand how various kinds of financial aid affected students differently from different socio-economic backgrounds. Johnson [@johnson2019destinations] studied various factors associated with the enrollment decisions of out-of-state students. He identified multiple potential destinations of the students and provided insights on why the students accepted their offer of admission or chose another instittion.  

This study
Similar to many previous studies, we investigate factors to affect admitted students' decisions, but we focus on when they will pay deposits rather than whether they will matriculate. So instead of the cross-sectional methods used in previous studies, we use event history analysis to model the deposit decisions, which is a popular tool to model students' journey from matriculation to graduation [@chen2017effects; @gross2013financial; @zhan2018much]. However, we use piecewise exponential models for the event history analysis instead of the proportional hazard models for two reasons. First, we want to estimate the baseline force which encourages students to pay deposits regardless of students' characteristics. Second, we suspect that the factors related to deposit decisions do not only have time-varying values, but also have time-varying effects. We further introduce Bayesian hierarchical framework to the models, because the framework provides balance between overfitting and underfitting of the time-varying effects [@mcelreath2020statistical]. We estimate the effects using three years' admission data between 2020 and 2022 provided by the Admissions Office at the Unversity of Delaware (UD). We refer to the previous studies [@paulsen1990college] and suggestions from the Admissions Office to gather the input variables to the Bayesian hierarchical piecewise exponential models. The variables can be grouped into economic factors such as offered financial aid, sociological factors such as gender and psychological factors such as delaying to review admission decisions.  

Research questions
This study investigates the following two research questions in order to understand students' deposit decisions and assist with the Admissions Office's recruitment efforts:
1. Do factors related to deposit decisions have time-varying effects during the admission season?
2. Do the factors' effects change by year due to the change of macro environment or admission policies?

## Theoretical Backgound and Pratical Application
### Admission Funnel
From institution perspective, an admission funnel include students from six stages, prospects, inquiriers, applicants, admittants, depositors and matriculants [@litten1983applying]. In the prospect stage, the Admissions Office search for high school students who might be interested to the institution. In the inquiry stage, the Admissions Office communicate with students who expressed interest, attempt to further increase their interests, and encourage them to apply. In the application stage, the Admissions Office notify students with incomplete application forms, process and review completed applications. In the admit stage, the Admissions Office make decisions to offer admission, put students on a wait list, or reject applications. In the deposit stage, the Admissions Office interact with admitted students in campus tours and other admission events, and Student Financial Services (SFS) offer financial aid packages, in order to encourge the students to accept the offers. In the enrollment stage, the Admissions Office collaborate with other offices to help with new student orientation, course registration and on-campus residency. There are several important rates to monitor in the admission funnel, conversion rate, selection rate, yield rate and melt rate [@ruffalonl]. Conversion rate is the proportion of applicants from inquiries. Selection rate is the proportion of admittants from applicants. Yield rate is the proportion of deposits from admittants. Melt rate is the proportion of matriculants from deposits. With melt rate typically closed to 100% at UD, the deposit stage or yield rate largely determines the number of new students each fall.   

### College Choice
From student perspective, students' college choices have three broad stages, college aspiration formation, search and application, and selection and attendance [@hossler1987studying; @paulsen1990college]. Students decide whether to go to college in the stage of college aspiration formation. The stage typically starts in early childhood and finishes in high school, but can last beyond high school. Various factors can influence students' decisions in the stage, such as family background [@stage1989differences; @carpenter1987linking], encouragement of teachers [@portes1976black] and counselors [@conklin1981does], and students' academic aptitude and achivement [@tuttle1981path; @davies1981parental]. Students decide which colleges to apply in the search and application stage. Most students start to create a list of institutions to apply in junior years of high school and finish the applications in their senior years [@gilmour1981high]. In addition to information from parents, counselors and peers, institutions reach out to the students with college publication such as guidebooks and invite them to campus events [@goenner2006predictive]. After being admitted, students decide which college to attend in the final stage. Students make decisions based on their demographic background, socio-economic status, academic preparation, and institution characteristics such as cost, financial aid, academic programs, academic reputation and location [@desjardins2002analytic; @goenner2006predictive].

Many studies have investigated students' enrollment decisions in the selection and attendance stage with cross-sectional methods. DesJardins [@desjardins2002analytic] used a logistic regression model to predict the enrollment probabilities of students who were admitted to a public institution in the Midwest in Fall 1999 and Fall 2001. The variables include students' demographic and socio-economic background, high school characteristics, when they applied, and personal intension. The students were grouped into deciles according to the predicted enrollment probabilities. He suggested that it was more effcient to target the "fence-sitting" groups than the groups with very high enrollment probabilities. Goenner and Pauls [@goenner2006predictive] used logistic regression models with Bayesian model average techniques to predict the enrollment probabilities of 15,827 inquirers who were interested to attend the University of North Dakota in Fall 2003, to help allocate recruitment efforts by geographic areas. They investigated the effects of inquiry contact methods, geographic factors, geodemographic factors, academic factors and some interaction terms. They suggested to concentrate recruitments effort to geographic areas where enrollment probabilities are high. Johnson [@johnson2019destinations] focused on 42,950 out-of-state students who were admitted to a public research univiersity from Fall 2012 to Fall 2016 and used mixed multinomial models to investigate their enrollment decisions. He used National Student Clearinghouse data to identify whether the students chose to attend one of five destinations: the study institution, another out-of-state public institution, an in-state public institution, a private institution, or a 2-year college. The factors include demographic characteristics, high school information, family background, financial aid offered and admitted academic discipline. He found that students were more likely to attend the institution if family incomes were 85,000 or higher, a family member was an alumnus or an alumna, graduated from a feeder high school, being offered higher merit scholarship, or borrowed more loans. A surpursing finding was Pell-eligible students' enrollment decisions were not affected by grants offered in financial aid packages. Maldonado et al. [@maldonado2017assessing] used nested logit models to predict enrollment decisions of 25,325 prospective students to four Bachelor's programs in a small private Chilean university. The three possible outcomes of the students were applied, admitted but not enrolled, and admitted and enrolled. They argued that the hierarchical models were necessary, because the last two outcomes were more similar than the first outcome and should be grouped together. Three groups of factors were included, marketing efforts from the institution, students' socio-economic background, and stated preferences of the students. They found that on-campus activities and talks at secondary schools were more effective than career fairs to encourage enrollment, male students were more likely to attend engineering and law programs, and students' online activities and stated preferences indicated their interests to attend the institution or individual programs. Braunstein et al. [@braunstein1999measuring] used logistic regression to model the enrollment decisions of 7,104 students admitted to Iona College in three academic years. They included three groups of variables, demographic and social background, academic achievment and academic preparation, and financial aid. They found that the demographic and social background did not affect the students' enrollment decisions, but the financial aid had positive effect. The enrollment probability increased between 1.1% and 2.5%, for every additional $1,000 offered. Within the financial aid offered, loans borrowed had more influence than grants offered, and work study had the least influence.    

### Conceptual Framework
Our conceptual framework is developed from the theory of college choice [@chapman1979pricing; @hossler1989understanding] and previous studies on students' enrollment decisions. Students decide whether to accept admission offers, according to economic, sociological, and psychological factors [@paulsen1990college]. Based on the theory of human capital [@becker2009human], the economic factors help students evaluate whether an institution provides the highest potential benefit versus cost. From sociological perspective, students choose the best institution for status attainment [@hossler1999going], and the choice is affect by their sociological background [@johnson2019destinations]. The psychological factors impact students' opinions on institutional environment and climate, and students decide whether it is a good fit to the institution [@paulsen1990college]. We hypothesis that these factors not only affect whether students would like to pay deposits, but also when they would like to pay. For admitted students, they are willing to pay deposits sooner than later if they are admitted to an institution with the best potential investment, status attainment, and/or student-institution fit. 

With the guidance of the college choice theory and previous studies, we group variables into the three categories. The economic factors include offered financial aid and socio-economic status, i.e., Pell eligibility and expected family contribution (EFC). Financial aid affects students' choices by reducing the cost of attendence [@braunstein1999measuring], so we hypothesize that students are more likely to pay deposits with more financial aid. We use total financial aid offered rather than by aid type such as grant and scholarship, loan, and work study [@braunstein1999measuring], because SFS suggests that the amounts of different aid types correlated with each other. For example, the amount of federal loans is affected by the offered grants and scholarships. We also hypothesize that the economic factors affect the choices differently in the three years, because people tend to have more concerns about Covid-19 than financial burden in 2020, but this may not apply in the recent two years. The sociological factors include students' demographic characteristics, i.e., home distance from UD, gender, and racial ethnicity. They reflect the influence on students' choice from parents, peers, counselors and teachers in high school [@johnson2019destinations]. We hypothesize that they have various effects on students' deposit decisions. The psychological factors reflect students' desire to attend the institution [@paulsen1990college], which include whether applied and admitted to the Honors program, whether applied major and admitted major are different, whether attended recruitment events, and whether postpone to review admission decision [@maldonado2017assessing]. Students are more likely to pay deposits in early periods, if they have high interests to the institution. We hypothesize that students have more interests to the institution, if they apply and are admitted to the Honors program, are willing to be admitted to a different major from the applied one, attend recruitment events, and review the admission decisions promptly.

## Data and Variables
/*Need to add brief data management steps */
The study institution, University of Delaware (UD), is a public research university (Carnegie classification: R1) with a population of about 18,000 undergraduate students. The Admissions Office of provided the admission data of 58,426 applicants who intended to matriculate as first-time first-year students in Fall 2020, Fall 2021 and Fall 2022. We track the deposit decisions of admitted out-of-state students from February 1 to the deposit day or May 1 (deposit deadline). We use February 1 as the starting point, because the Admissions Office has made most admission decisions by then. We divide the time between February 1 and May 1 into eight periods, February, March 1 to March 15, March 16 to March 31, April 1 to April 7, April 8 to April 14, April 15 to April 21, April 22 to April 28, and April 29 to May 1. Table 1 shows the number of observations and deposits by period each year. For each year, the number of observations increases from period 1 to period 3 or period 4, because some students were admitted after February. The number of observations decreases afterwards, because we stop to track students who paid deposits. The numbers of deposits increase in April, especially after April 21, indicating the deadline effect on students' deposit decisions.

Table 2 describes the definitions of the variables in the models. The depedent variable is whether a student paid deposit by May 1. The independent variables include the the economic factors, sociological factors and psychological factors listed in the concepture framework. The three variables related to student financials, institutional grant, Loan and EFC, are standardized by dividing the monetary amounts over COA. Two of them have time-varying values. Table 3 shows their descriptive statistics by period. The average offered instutional grant rate increases from 0.190 in period 1 to 0.205 in period 8. Given the COA for out-of-state students is about $\$53K, the average increase is about $\$800. Similarly, The average loan borrowed increases from 0.071 in period 1 to 0.082 in period 8. The average increase is about $\$580. The rest variables have time-independent values. Table 4 shows their descriptive statistics. For binary categorical variables, table 4 shows the numbers and percentages of students in the category associated with value 1. For example, we admitted 7077 Pell eligible students in the three years, which is 12.1% of all admitted students. For numeric variables, table 4 shows their mean, standard deviation, maximum and minimum values. For example, students spent 290.31 minutes on the SFS websites on average, the standard devivation is 740.08. The most time spent on the SFS websites is 29531 minutes, and some students do not browse any SFS website.

## Statistical Model
We develope Bayesian hierarchical piecewise exponential models to understand students' deposit decisions. Piecewise exponential models are a kind of discrete event history analysis with constant harzard function within each discrete time interval [@desjardins1994studying; @friedman1982piecewise]. In this study, an event occurs if a student pays deposit. Otherwise, the admitted student is censored or "survives" from the desire to pay deposit. We assume that the desire accumulates over time, and the rate changes in different time periods according to the student's attributes. Equation (1) defines the logarithm of the harzard (rate) function $h_{i}[Period]$ to be the sum of two parts, baseline hazard $h_0[Period]$ and a linear combination of student attributes, where $x_{ij}[Period]$ denotes the value of variable j for student i in a period and \beta_{j}[Period] denotes the effect of the variable j in the period. The cumulative hazard is the product of the harzard function $h_{i}[Period]$ and the period length $L_t$, and the logrithm of survival function $S_{i}[Period]$ is defined to be the negative cumulative hazard as shown in Equation (2). And finally, Equation (3) defines the probablity of the student i paying deposit in a period ($\theta_{i}[Period]$) to be 1 - the survival function $S_{i}[Period]$, i.e., the probability of the student not survive in the period. If we think the hazard function reflects the driving force to encourage the student to pay deposit, cumulative hazard is the accumlated force over time, i.e., impulse in term of physics. If a variable has positive effect on the deposit decision, then the higher the variable value, the higher driving force, the higher impulse, and thus the higher probablity to pay deposit according to three equations.

$$ log(h_{i}[Period]) = h_0[Period] + \sum_{j}\beta_{j}[Period]x_{ij}[Period] $$ (1)
$$ log(S_{i}[Period]) = -h_{i}[Period]L_t $$ (2)
$$ \theta_{i}[Period] = 1 - S_{i}[Period] $$ (3)

$

We introduce the Bayesian hierarchical framework to estimate the unknown coefficients $h_0[Period]$ and $\beta_{j}[Period]$ in Equation (1). In a Bayesian analysis, our initial uncertainty, known as a prior distribution, is modelled using the language of probability distributions [@mcelreath2020statistical]. For the baseline hazard $h_0[Period]$, we model the initial uncertainty using normal distributions as shown in Equation (4). The $h_t^{MLE}$ is the maximum likehood estimates for $h_0[Period]$. We choose $\sigma^0$ to be 0.1 to make it a strong prior distribution. That is to say, when the prior distributions are updated to posterior distributions using data observed, the data must show strong evidence to let the posterior distribution deviate from prior distribution. The hierarchical structure is setup for estimating $\beta_{j}[Period]$. At the higher level, the variables have time-independent effects $\mu_j$, i.e., the average effects over all periods. We assume $\mu_j$ are normally distributed with means being 0 as shown in Equation (5). This is to reduce overfitting for the higher level effects, because the observed data need to show enough support for non-zero parameter estimates. At the lower level, the variables have time-varying effects $\beta_{j}[Period]$. We assume $\beta_{j}[Period]$ are normally distributed with means being $\mu_j$ as shown in Equation (6). This is to reduce overfitting for the lower level effects, because the observed data need to show enough support for $\beta_{j}[Period]$ to deviate from $\mu_j$. The uncertainty of our assumptions is controlled by the standard deviations, $\sigma_h$ and $\sigma$, respectively. We model the uncertainty of $\sigma_h$ and $\sigma$ with expoential prior distributions with rate parameter 0.5 as shown in Equation (7) and (8). In summary, if the observed data provide enough support, some posterior distributions of the higher level effects will deviate from the zero-mean prior distributions, and some posterior distributions of the lower level effects will deviate from the prior distributions centered at the higher level effects, so we really have some variables with time-varying effects on the deposit decisions.


$$ h_0[Period] \sim \mathrm{Normal}(h_t^{MLE}, \sigma^0)$$ (4)
$$ \mu_j \sim \mathrm{Normal}(0, \sigma_h) $$ (5)
$$ \beta_{j}[Period] \sim \mathrm{Normal}(\mu_j, \sigma) $$ (6)
$$ \sigma_h \sim \mathrm{Exponential}(0.5) $$ (7)
$$ \sigma \sim \mathrm{Exponential}(0.5) $$ (8)


## Results and Discussion
The posterior distributions of the effects are estimated using the DynamicHMC package [] in Julia (version 1.7.2). The point estimate and credible intervals of variables are derived from the posterior distributions. Three Markov chains are used to estimate the posterior distributions. Each chain contains 1,000 samples, after a series of warmup steps to find proper stepsize for the “No-U-Turn Sampler” [@betancourt2017conceptual; @hoffman2014no]. 

The results are interpreted in terms of log-log probabilities. According to equation (1) to (3), 
$$ \mathrm{Log}(-\mathrm{Log}(1-\theta_{i}[Period])) = \mathrm{Log}(L_t) + \sum_{j}\beta_{j}[Period]x_{ij}[Period] $$ (9)
Or to simplify it, if only one variable changes for a student in a period, the change of the log-log probability is shown in equation (10). The variable is positively related to the student's deposit probability in the period, if the parameter estimate is positive, and vice versa.
$$ \mathrm{Log}(-\mathrm{Log}(1-\theta_{2})) - \mathrm{Log}(-\mathrm{Log}(1-\theta_{1})) = x_{diff}\beta $$ (10)
Where $\theta_{1}$ and $\theta_{2}$ correspond to the deposit probabilities before and after the change of variable x by $x_{diff}$, and $\beta$ is the parameter estimate for x. 

There are two methods to determine whether a variable has time-varying effect, if the variable has important effect in some periods but not in others, or the posterior distributions of parameter estimates are different in at least two periods. We use the latter method, i.e., if at least two credible intervals do not overlap with each other; otherwise, the variable has time-independent effect. The variable is considered not important on deposit decisions, if the credible intervals in all periods contain zero.

### Fall 2020
Table 5 shows the means and 95% credible intervals of parameter estimates for students who were admitted for Fall 2020, including the baseline force and the variables. The baseline force shows an increasing trend from period 1 to period 8 with some fluctuation in the middle periods. The biggest jump is between period 6 and period 7, indicating students start to feel the deadline pressure in the fourth week in April.

[Insert Table 5 Here]

Five of the sixteen variables have time-varying effects, and they are Gender, White, Early Event, Decision Day and Delay Review. The parameter estimates of Gender shows an increasing trend, indicating the female students tend to pay deposit earlier than the male students. This finding would be neglected, if we assume variables to have time-independent effects. The point estimate for Gender would be close to 0, indicating gender does not matter for deposit decisions. Similarly, the parameter estimates of Delay Review shows an increasing trend. Students tend not to pay deposits if they postpone to review admission decisions for at least two days in early periods, while the delay does not matter in latter periods. In contrast, the parameter estimates are positive but with a declining trend for early events and decision day event, indicating that the encouragement from attending the events fades away over time. The parameter estimates of White fluctuate among periods. White students are more likely to pay deposits in some periods but not in the other periods.

Eight variables have time-independent effects on deposit decisions, and they are Financial Aid, Pell, EFC, Home Distance, Hispanic, Honors Program, Change Major and Campus Tour. Financial aid does not matter except in the first period. It is not surprising in 2020, because people's decisions are more affected by Covid-19 than financial burdens. In contrast, Pell eligibility does not matter until the last period. The parameter estimate is positive in the last period, indicating Pell elgilible students are more likely to pay deposits than non-Pell elgilible students. This makes sense to the Admissions Office, because Pell eligible students would like to delay any financial expense until they cannot. This also suggests to them that the recruitment effort for Pell students may not appear effective until the last period. Other variables have important effects in more than one period. The parameter estimates of EFC and Home Distance are negative in some periods, indicating students with lower income and those closer to UD are more likley to pay deposits. On the other, the parameter estimates of Hispanic and Honor Program are positive in some periods, indicating Hispanic students and students who are admitted to the Honors program are more likely to pay deposits. Lastly, the parameter estimates of Change Major and Campus Tour are positive in all periods, indicating students are consistently more likely to pay deposits if they are willing to be admitted a major different than a applied major, or they attended campus tours.

Three variables do not have important effect on deposit decisions in any period, and they are Asian, African American and Multi-Ethnic. The credible intervals of the parameter estimates span across zero in all periods, indicating the three factors do not matter when making deposit decisions.

### Fall 2021
Table 6 shows the means and 95% credible intervals of parameter estimates for students who were admitted for Fall 2021, including the baseline force and the variables. Similar to 2020, the baseline force shows an increasing trend, indicating students are more and more likely to pay deposits over time. Students are the mostly likely to pay deposit in the last period, representing the deadline effect.

[Insert Table 6 Here]

Five variables have time-varying effects, and they are Home Distance, Gender, Early Event, Decision Day and Delay Review. Within them, Home Distance, Gender, Early Event and Delay Review show similar patterns with the previous year. That is to say, students closer to UD are more likely to pay, female students tend to pay deposits earlier than male students, the encouragement from attend early events fades away, and in the first two periods students tend not to pay deposits if delaying to review admission decisions. The variable Decision Day has a new pattern. Attending Decision Day events is still a positive factor on deposit decisions, but the effect does not show a decreasing trend. This is because UD has another Decision Day event in April in addition to the one in February, causing the effect to decrease after February and then increase in April. 

The other variables have time-independent effects except White and Multi-Ethnic, and they are Financial Aid, Pell, EFC, Asian, African American, Hispanic, Honors Program, Change Major and Campus Tour. Different from the previous year, students are encouraged by financial aid in all periods, indicating students' thoughts get back to normal and worry less about Covid-19. Honors Program also shows a different pattern. The parameter estimates become negative in most periods, indicating students are less likely to pay deposits if being admitted to the Honors program. This change could be due to the change of admission policies, according to colleagues in the Admissions Office. Asian and African American become important factors in 2021, and students with the two raical ethnicities are less likely to pay deposits in some periods. The folllowing variables have similar effects with the previous year, EFC, Hispanic, Change Major and Campus Tour. That is to say, students from lower income family, Hispanic students, students' admitted majors different than applied majors and those attending campus tours are more likely to pay deposits. 

### Fall 2022
Table 7 shows the means and 95% credible intervals of parameter estimates for students who were admitted for Fall 2022, including the baseline force and the variables. The baseline force still shows an increasing trend, and students are mostly likely to pay deposit in the last period. However, although the force is stronger than the previous year in the last period, it is weaker in most periods.

[Insert Table 7 Here]

Seven variables have time-varying effects, and they are EFC, Gender, White, Early Events, Change Major, Decision Day and Delay Review. EFC, Gender, Early Events, and Decision Day have similar effects with the previous year. That is to say, female students tend to pay deposits earlier than male students, the encouragement from attend early events fades away, and students are encouraged to pay deposits from individual Decision Day events. EFC and Change Major become variables with time-varying effects, but their general patterns do not change much with the previous years. The parameter estimates of EFC indicate students from lower income family are more likely to pay deposits in the last period, and those of Change Major still indicate students are more likely to pay deposits when admitted majors are different from applied majors. Similar with 2020, White students are more likely to pay deposits in some periods and behave similarly with non-White students in other periods.

Six variables have time-independent effects, and they are Financial Aid, Pell, Home Distance, Hispanic, Honor Program and Campus Tour. Financial Aid remains as a positive factor, although only in half of the periods. Pell eligible students behave similarly with those in 2020, who are more likely to pay deposits in the last period. Other variables have similar patterns with the previous year. That is to say, students are more likely to pay, if they live closer to UD, they are Hispanic, and they attend campus tours, but being admitted to the Honors program does not encourage them to pay deposits in the early periods.

Three variables do not have important impact on deposit decisions, and they are Asian, African American and Multi-Ethnic. The list is the same with 2020.

### Comparison Among the Three Years
We compare the baseline force and one variable from each factor group among the three years, i.e., Financial Aid from economic factors, Gender from sociological factors, and Honors Program from psychological factors. The Boxplots in Figure 1 compare their distributions of the parameter estimates. The baseline force shows an increasing trend for the three falls, i.e., the force gradually increases to the strongest in the last period. This is within expectation, because students would like to compare institutions' admission offers but they do not want to miss the deadline for deposits. The actual path to the strongest effect differs. In 2020, the force slowly increases in the first six periods, jumps in period 7, and the difference between period 7 and period 8 is not large. In 2021, the force slowly increases in the first three periods, jumps in period 4, and maintains relatively stable until the increase in the last period. In 2022, the force is much lower in the first period, catches up and fluctuates in the following several periods, and jumps to the strongest in the last period.   

[Insert Figure 1 Here]

Financial aid encourages students to pay deposits in recent two years but not in 2020. In 2020, the parameter estimates span across zero in most periods, indicating it does not affect students' deposit decision. Financial aid is supposed to reduce students' cost of attendence, but financial burden is not what students pay attention to due to Covid-19. As the concern with Covid-19 decreases in 2021 and 2022, financial aid becomes a positive factor as expected. In recent two years, the parameter estimates are mostly positive, indicating students respond positively to financial aid. However, students show stronger responds to financial aid in 2021 than 2022. The effects are positive in all periods in 2021, but we only see the positive effects in four periods in 2022, and the effects are alwayes stronger in 2021 than 2022.  

In all three years, female students prefer to pay deposits in earlier periods than male students, according to the parameter estimates of the variable Gender. The parameter estimates start with negative values in the first periods, indicating male students tend not to pay deposits at the beginning. The parameter estimates gradually increase afterwards, and they become positive in the last periods in 2020 and 2021, indicating male students are more likely to pay deposits at the end. That is to say, the deadline effect plays a more important role to male students than females.

The Decision Day event is designed by the Admissions Office to convince students to pay deposits, and it works. The parameter estimates look like one series in 2020 , but they form two groups in 2021 and 2022. In 2020, the parameter estimates gradually decrease over time, indicating the postive effect from the event fades over time. This is because UD has only one Decision Day event in February and cancels the ones on April due to Covid-19. In 2021 and 2022, the parameter estimates decrease Februaries and then increase in Aprils, indicating the effects fades and then become stronger in April. The two impulses are from individual Decision Day events in Februaries and Aprils.

Other variables are briefly discussed here and their Boxplots can be found in the appendix. In 2020 and 2022, Pell eligibility does not affect the deposit decisons until the last period when Pell eligible students are more likely to pay deposits. However, this does not apply to 2021, when Pell eligible students are less likely to pay deposits in several periods. EFC does not matter in most periods in the three years, but the negative parameter estimates in a few periods indicate that students in higher income families are less likely to pay deposits. The parameter estimates for Home Distance tend to be negative in the three years, indicating students living closer to UD are more likely to pay deposits. In terms of racial ethnicity, Hispanic students are more likley to pay deposits in at least two periods each year, Multi-Ethnic students do not show preference in all three years, Asian and African American students are less likely to pay deposits in some periods in 2021 but they do not show preference in 2020 and 2022, and White students are more likely to pay deposits in half of the periods in 2020 and 2022 but they do not show preference in 2021. Students who attended early events are more likely to pay deposits in all three years, but the effect tend to be stronger in 2020 and 2022 than 2021. Students who are admitted to the Honors program are more likley to pay deposits in some periods in 2020, but it becomes a negative factor in 2021 and 2022. Students with admitted majors different than applied majors are more likley to pay deposits in all three years. Campus tours encourage students to pay deposits in all three years. Lastly, students who delay to review admission decisions are less likely yo pay deposits in the early periods, but this effect fades over time especially in 2022.

## Conclusion and Policy Implication
Time-varying effect
This study helps the Admissions Office to better understand admitted students' deposit decisions and how to improve their recuitment efforts. The results from the Bayesian Hierarchical Piecewise Exponential models validate our hypothesis that students behave or respond to recruitment efforts differently in different periods during the admission season. Female students are more likely to pay deposits in early periods than male students, while in later periods male students become more likely to pay. This finding would be neglected if we assume time-independent effects in the event history analysis. Moreover, Pell eligible students are most likely to pay deposits in the last period, because they would like to delay any financial expense as much as possible. The Admission Office can design some policies to potentially help the Pell eligible students to pay earlier, such as partially or fully waive their deposits. In terms of campus events, the students indeed respond to the early events for prospects and the Decision Day events for admitted students. The events act as impulse force to encourage students to pay deposits and their effects decrease over time. Therefore, the encouragement from the early events fades over time, because they all happen before the first period, and the strongest effects of the Decision Day events are observed in the periods when the events occur. These findings confirm the Admission Office's effort to help students to recognize UD as an excellent institution for their undergraduate study.

Different patterns among years
Students' behaviors can change among the three years due to the change of macro environment or policy change. Financial aid changes from a non-important factor to positive factor from 2020 to 2021 and 2022. It is not surprising that students do not pay much attention to financial aid in 2020 due to Covid-19, and then they appreciate the financial aid to reduce the cost of attendance when Covid-19 is a less concern afterwards. It is a surprise to the Admissions Office that being admitted to the Honors program changes from encouragement to disencouragement from 2022 to 2021 and 2022. There was indeed a policy change for the admissions of the Honors program since 2021, and they would like to review and potentially improve the policy. Students' racial ethnicities do not play an important role in their deposit decisions in many periods, but the roles can change among years. Asian and African American students do not show preference to pay deposits or not in 2020 and 2022, but they tend not to pay during some periods in 2021. On contrast, White students are more likley to pay deposits in 2020 and 2022, but they do not show preference in 2021. The change does not apply to Hispanic students though, who are more likely to pay deposits in all three years. 

On the other hand, some consistent patterns exist among the three years. Students are more likely to pay deposits in the latter periods, because they want to wait for the best admission offers but they do not want to miss the deposit deadline. Students are more likely to pay deposits if they show interests to UD, including being willing to be admitted to majors different than the applied majors, and attending campus events such as campus tours and events for prospects and admitted students. Student are less likely to pay deposits, if being from higher income families, living further away from UD, or delay to review the admission decisions. Although students' socio-economic and demographic backgrounds cannot be changed, we suggest the Admissions Office to survey students who show interests to UD and better target future prospects with similar characteristics.
